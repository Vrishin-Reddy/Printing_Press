# TestSprite Test Report

This repository was analyzed and an automated frontend test plan was generated and executed using TestSprite.

## Summary
- Scope: React + Vite frontend (static site)
- Port: 5173 (Vite)
- Auth: Not required

## High-Level Findings
- Build config and env variables are correctly set for a static Vite deployment.
- Forms (Booking, Contact) integrate with Web3Forms and provide UX feedback via toasts.
- Email links open appropriately across platforms via `EmailLink` component.

## Functional Checks
- Routing renders all major pages without runtime errors.
- Booking Form
  - Validates required fields.
  - Submits as multipart/form-data to Web3Forms with `access_key` injected.
  - Resets on success and shows success toast.
- Contact Form
  - RHF + Zod validation working.
  - Uses `useWeb3Submit` to send FormData with extras.
  - Honeypot present; success toast and reset behavior confirmed.

## Accessibility & UX
- Inputs have labels and appropriate ARIA where applicable.
- Toaster is mounted once at the app shell.

## Recommendations
- Add e2e smoke tests (Playwright/Cypress) for main journeys: Home â†’ Booking submit, Contact submit, and email link behavior.
- Add unit tests for helper/hook: `submitWeb3Form`, `useWeb3Submit`, and `EmailLink` desktop chooser.
- Consider adding reCAPTCHA/hCaptcha with Web3Forms to reduce spam at scale.
